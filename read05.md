# The color of HTML and CSS..

* HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.

* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to specify the overall appearance of webpages as well as the appearance and structure of the text and elements such as images and buttons on webpages and their layout. Styles can be specified with CSS using internal style sheet definitions which are placed right into HTML/XHTML code or in external files.
 
 *Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps  X convey the mood and evokes reactions.*
