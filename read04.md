*HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:*

* (header) - Defines a header for a document or a section.

* (nav) - Defines a set of navigation links.

* (section) - Defines a section in a document.

* (article ) - Defines an independent, self-contained content.

* (footer) - Defines a footer for a document or a section.

# Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

# The aim of a wireframe is to provide a visual understanding of a page early in a project to get stakeholder and project team approval before the creative phase gets under way. Wireframes can also be used to create the global and secondary navigation to ensure the terminology and structure used for the site meets user expectations.
