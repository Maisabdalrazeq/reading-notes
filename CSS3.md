# CSS3 

*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) consist of a group of formatting rules that you use to control the layout and appearance of the content on a web page. One really great feature of CSS is that you can store all the CSS rules in one document and keep that document separate from the HTML content and link the two together. Then, when you make a change to the CSS that change is instantly and automatically updated on all the HTML files. Another great feature is that it "cleans up" the appearance of the code on web pages. In addition it will speed up browser loading times.*
